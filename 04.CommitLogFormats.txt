Git commands are huge and we don't need to learn all of them, as always we can refer the documentation, but knowing few of them will really helpful if we have them on finger tips. I will show around the most useful log formats.

1.Display all the commits for a branch.
    git log --all

2.Display only the N number of commits.
    git log -5

3.Show the commits by Author or Committer.
    git log --author <name>
    git log --committer <name>

4.Show the commits by N Days Ago.

5.Display the commits by Date Range.

6.Display the results in one line.
    git log --oneline

7.Using the Formatting options on the Git Log.
    git log --pretty=format:"<options>"

8.How to save the logs messages to a csv or delimiter file.
