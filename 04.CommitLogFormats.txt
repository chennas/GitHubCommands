================================================

Git commands are huge and we don't need to learn all of them, as always we can refer the documentation, but knowing few of them will really helpful if we have them on finger tips. I will show around the most useful log formats.

1.Display all the commits for a branch.
    git log --all

2.Display only the N number of commits.
    git log -5

3.Show the commits by Author or Committer.
    git log --author <name> {{Chris Ram√≥n}}
    git log --committer <name>

4.Show the commits by N Days Ago.

5.Display the commits by Date Range.

6.Display the results in one line.
    git log --oneline

7.Using the Formatting options on the Git Log.
    git log --pretty=format:"<options>"

    %h --> sha1 commit ids in short format.
    %H --> sha1 commit ids in long format.
    %ad --> The date when the commit is created.
    %s --> Commit Subject message.
    %an --> Author name.

    The below are some other options we use in conjunction to change the color of the text while displaying the commit messages.
        %Creset: Changes the color back to default(white) color
        %Cgreen: Changes the text color to green
        %Cred: Changes the text color to red
        %Cblue: Make the author name blue in color
        %C(CustomColorName): Turn the following string to yellow
            Example: %C(yellow): To change the text color to yellow.


8.How to save the logs messages to a csv or delimiter file.
    git log --oneline > GitCommits.log
