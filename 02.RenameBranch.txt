In this video I will show you how to rename a GIT Branch in your local repository and push to GitHub Cloud.

There are 3 steps to do this.

Step 1. Rename the branch locally.
    git branch -m old_branch_name new_branch_name

Step 2. Delete the branch from your git hub cloud repository
    git push origin --delete old_branch_name

    git push origin :old_branch_name

Step 3. Push the new branch to your git hub account in cloud.
    git push origin new_branch_name
